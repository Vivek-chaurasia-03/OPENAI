        <h2 class="h-secondary center">Machine Learning</h2>
        <p class="center">Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve
            automatically through experience and by the use of data.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial
            intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training
            data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="center">Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being
            explicitly programmed to do so. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out
            certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the
            machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning
            is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed
            algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm,
            rather than having human programmers specify every needed step.[9]

            The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where
            no fully satisfactory algorithm is available. In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one
            approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid. This can then be used as training data for the
            computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers. For example, to train a system
            for the task of digital character recognition, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits has often been used.

        <p class="center">As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence.
            In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn
            from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then
            termed "neural networks"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be
            reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[22] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed,
            especially in automated medical diagnosis.[23]: 488 

            However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and
            machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data
            acquisition and representation.[23]: 488  By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics
            was out of favor.[24] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive
            logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in
            pattern recognition and information retrieval.[23]: 708–710, 755  Neural networks research had been
            abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS
            field, as "connectionism", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton.
            Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[23]: 25 
            <br><br>
            Machine learning (ML), reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed
            its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It
            shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models
            borrowed from statistics and probability theory.[24]

            As of 2020, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a subfield of AI.[25][26][20] The
            main disagreement is whether all of ML is part of AI, as this would mean that anyone using ML could claim
            they are using AI. Others have the view that not all of ML is part of AI[27][28][29] where only an
            'intelligent' subset of ML is part of AI.[30]

            The question to what is the difference between ML and AI is answered by Judea Pearl in The Book of Why.[31]
            Accordingly, ML learns and predicts based on passive observations, whereas AI implies an agent interacting
            with the environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its
            goals.[34]
