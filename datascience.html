                <p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes,
                    algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured
                    data and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of
                    application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.
                    <br><br>
                    Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related
                    methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.It uses techniques and
                    theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science,
                    information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science
                    and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm"
                    of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that
                    "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data
                    deluge.</p>

                    Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are
                    typically large (see big data), and applying the knowledge and actionable insights from data to
                    solve problems in a wide range of application domains.The field encompasses preparing data for
                    analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and
                    presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains. As such,
                    it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science, mathematics,
                    information visualization, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and
                    business. 
                    <br><br>
                    Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to
                    human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data.In
                    2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine
                    learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional
                    communities.

                    Many statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but
                    rather another name for statistics.Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics
                    because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data.Vasant Dhar writes that
                    statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with
                    quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. images) and emphasizes prediction and action.[14] Andrew
                    Gelman of Columbia University has described statistics as a nonessential part of data science.
                    Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the
                    size of datasets or use of computing, and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their
                    analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program. He describes data
                    science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics. In summary, data science can
                    be therefore described as an applied branch of statistics.

                <p>Artificial intelligence is the technological blow that took the world by storm. When the term ‘artificial
                    intelligence’ was first coined at a conference, no one imagined that one day, it will replace all the repetitive
                     jobs and relieve humans from performing heavy labour works. The advent of the internet helped technology to
                     progress exponentially. Artificial intelligence stood alone for the past three decades, and now, it is
                     streamlining with widespread sub-technologies and applications. From biometrics and computer vision to smart
                    devices and self-driving cars, emerging trends are fuelling the <u>AI craze</u>. Henceforth, <strong>Analytics
                    Insight has listed the top 10 AI technologies that are taking innovation to next level in 2021</strong>
