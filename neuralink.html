                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Neura Link</h2>
                <p class="center">Neuralink Corporation is a neurotechnology company developing implantable
                    brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) and founded by Elon Musk and others. The company's headquarters is
                    in the Pioneer Building in San Francisco sharing offices with OpenAI. Neuralink was launched in
                    2016 and was first publicly reported in March 2017.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="center">In 2018, Gizmodo reported that Neuralink "remained highly secretive about its work",
                    although public records showed that it had sought to open an animal testing facility in San
                    Francisco; it subsequently started to carry out research at the University of California, Davis.[20]
                    In 2019, during a live presentation at the California Academy of Sciences, the Neuralink team
                    revealed to the public the technology of the first prototype they had been working on. It is a
                    system that involves ultra-thin probes that will be inserted into the brain, a neurosurgical robot
                    that will perform the operations and a high-density electronic system capable of processing
                    information from neurons. It is based on technology developed at UCSF and UC Berkeley</p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="center">Neuralink was founded in 2016 by Elon Musk, Max Hodak, Ben Rapoport, Dongjin Seo, Paul
                    Merolla, Philip Sabes, Tim Gardner, Tim Hanson and Vanessa Tolosa, a group of experts in areas such
                    as neuroscience, biochemistry and robotics.[6] The trademark "Neuralink" was purchased from its
                    previous owners in January 2017.[13]
                    <br>
                    In April 2017, Neuralink announced that it was aiming to make devices to treat serious brain
                    diseases in the short-term, with the eventual goal of human enhancement, sometimes called
                    transhumanism.[14][6][15] Musk had said his interest in the idea partly stemmed from the science
                    fiction concept of "neural lace" in the fictional universe in The Culture, a series of 10 novels by
                    Iain M. Banks.[15][16]
                    <br>
                    Musk defined the neural lace as a "digital layer above the cortex" that would not necessarily imply
                    extensive surgical insertion but ideally an implant through a vein or artery.[17] Musk explained
                    that the long-term goal is to achieve "symbiosis with artificial intelligence",[18] which he
                    perceives as an existential threat to humanity if it goes unchecked.[18][19]
                    <br>
                    As of 2020, Neuralink is headquartered in San Francisco's Mission District, sharing the Pioneer
                    building with OpenAI, another company co-founded by Musk.[20][4] Jared Birchall, the head of Musk's
                    family office, was listed as CEO, CFO and president of Neuralink in 2018.[21][20] As of September
                    2018, Musk was the majority owner of Neuralink but did not hold an executive position.[22]
                    <br>
                    By August 2020, only three of the eight founding scientists remained at the company, according to an
                    article by Stat News which reported that Neuralink had seen "years of internal conflict in which
                    rushed timelines have clashed with the slow and incremental pace of science."[23]
                    <br>
                    In April 2021, Neuralink demonstrated a monkey playing the game "Pong" using the Neuralink
                    implant.[24] While similar technology has existed since 2002, when a research group first
                    demonstrated a monkey moving a computer cursor with neural signals, scientists acknowledged the
                    engineering progress in making the implant wireless and increasing the number of implanted
                    electrodes.[25][26][27]
                    <br>
                    In May 2021, co-founder and president Max Hodak announced that he no longer works with the
                    company.[28]
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="center">Neuralink says they have developed a robot capable of rapidly inserting many flexible
                    probes into the brain, which may avoid the problems of tissue damage and longevity associated with
                    larger and more rigid probes. This robot has an insertion head with a 40 μm diameter
                    needle made of tungsten-rhenium designed to attach to the insertion loops, made to transport and
                    insert individual probes, and to penetrate the meninges and tissue cerebral. The robot is capable of
                    inserting up to six wires (192 electrodes) per minute.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="center">Neuralink has developed an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) to create a
                    1,536-channel recording system. This system consists of 256 amplifiers capable of being individually
                    programmed ("analog pixels"), analog-to-digital converters within the chip ("ADCs") and a peripheral
                    circuit control to serialize the digitized information obtained.[31] It aims to convert information
                    obtained from neurons into an understandable binary code in order to achieve greater understanding
                    of brain function and the ability to stimulate these neurons back. Currently, electrodes are still
                    too big to record the firing of individual neurons, so they can record only the firing of a group of
                    neurons; Neuralink representatives believe this issue might get mitigated algorithmically, but it's
                    computationally expensive and does not produce exact results.[34]

                    In July 2020, according to Musk, Neuralink obtained a FDA breakthrough device designation which
                    allows limited human testing under the FDA guidelines for medical devices.</p>
